# KuberCoins

This repository contains resource definitions to build and run the DockerCoins demo app
on Kubernetes.

/!\ **Warning**: as it is configured, skaffold run wuild work fine with minikube started (and the context minikube as the current one), but the registry need to be defined for the default build. /!\
